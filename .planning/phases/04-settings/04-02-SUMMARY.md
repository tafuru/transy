# Phase 4 Plan 2: Settings UI & Model Guidance Summary

**One-liner:** Compact settings pane with supported-language picker, conditional model guidance, and System Settings integration

## What Was Built

Replaced the placeholder Settings screen with a real compact native pane showing a target-language picker populated from Apple's supported languages. Implemented conditional model guidance that stays absent before relevance, shows generic guidance after a real missing-model event with unknown pair certainty, and can upgrade to pair-specific guidance when trusted known-pair context exists. Added runtime→settings relevance recording so missing-model outcomes from the popup flow inform Settings guidance without mutating active requests. Created SupportedLanguageOption for natural-language picker labels and TranslationModelGuidance for the conditional guidance state machine with Wave 0 test coverage.

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Wave 0 — lock guidance-state behavior with focused tests

**Files:**
- Created: `Transy/Settings/TranslationModelGuidance.swift`, `TransyTests/TranslationModelGuidanceTests.swift`
- Modified: `Transy/Settings/SettingsStore.swift`, `Transy.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`

**What was done:**
- Created `TranslationModelGuidance` struct with `GuidanceState` enum (none/generic/pairSpecific)
- Added `MissingModelContext` to track missing-model relevance from runtime outcomes
- Extended `SettingsStore` with `missingModelContext` and `recordMissingModel()` method
- Implemented Wave 0 tests covering all three guidance states
- Injected `statusProvider` for testability without depending on live Apple assets
- Ensured guidance is `.none` before relevance, `.generic` after missing-model with unknown pair, and `.pairSpecific` only when trusted known-pair context exists and status is `.supported`

**Commit:** `d375fa2`

**Verification:** TranslationModelGuidanceTests passes (5 tests covering all state transitions)

### Task 2: Build the compact Settings UI, supported-language picker, and guidance action

**Files:**
- Created: `Transy/Settings/SupportedLanguageOption.swift`
- Modified: `Transy/Settings/SettingsView.swift`, `Transy/Settings/TranslationModelGuidance.swift`, `Transy/Translation/TranslationAvailabilityClient.swift`, `Transy/Popup/PopupView.swift`, `Transy/AppDelegate.swift`, `Transy/Popup/PopupController.swift`, `Transy.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`

**What was done:**
- Created `SupportedLanguageOption` to load supported languages from Apple's API with localized display names
- Replaced placeholder `SettingsView` with real compact pane showing target-language picker
- Picker populated from `LanguageAvailability.supportedLanguages`, sorted by display name
- Added conditional guidance section that appears only when `guidanceState != .none`
- Implemented generic and pair-specific guidance variants with System Settings action
- Refined `TranslationAvailabilityClient.PreflightResult` to distinguish `.missingModel` from `.unsupported` and `.failed`
- Wired `PopupView` to record missing-model relevance into `SettingsStore` when preflight returns `.missingModel`
- Passed `settingsStore` through `AppDelegate` → `PopupController` → `PopupView` for relevance recording
- Settings pane stays compact by default, expands modestly when guidance becomes visible
- Button action opens Language & Region pane in System Settings via `x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.Localization-Settings`

**Commit:** `fcc1f9a`

**Verification:** Full test suite passes (37 tests)

### Task 3 Continuation: Fix blank picker and improve System Settings guidance

**Files:**
- Modified: `Transy/Settings/SettingsView.swift`

**What was done:**
- Added `selectedLanguageID` @State to manage picker selection independently of stored target
- Implemented `reconcileSelectedLanguage()` to reconcile stored target with supported options after language list loads
- Added fallback logic: if stored target not in supported list, select first supported language and update store
- Disabled picker while `supportedLanguages` is empty (during loading)
- Updated guidance copy to include explicit path: "System Settings → General → Language & Region → Translation Languages"
- Renamed button from "Open System Settings" to "Open Language & Region" for clarity
- Added detailed comment explaining URL scheme compatibility across macOS versions

**Commit:** `090f763`

**Verification:** Full test suite passes (37 tests), build succeeds

**Reason for fix:** User feedback from checkpoint verification identified two issues:
1. Blank picker on first launch when stored target doesn't match supported options
2. System Settings action opens to last-viewed pane rather than Language & Region

**Resolution:**
1. Picker reconciliation ensures valid selection after async language loading
2. Explicit guidance copy makes the next step obvious even if System Settings doesn't land in Translation Languages sub-section

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Blank picker on first launch**
- **Found during:** Checkpoint verification (Task 3)
- **Issue:** Picker appeared blank on first launch because binding used `settingsStore.targetLanguage.minimalIdentifier` before `supportedLanguages` loaded, and SwiftUI couldn't match the selection to any tag
- **Fix:** Added `selectedLanguageID` @State, implemented reconciliation logic after language loading, and disabled picker during empty state
- **Files modified:** `Transy/Settings/SettingsView.swift`
- **Commit:** `090f763`

**2. [Rule 2 - Missing functionality] Explicit System Settings guidance path**
- **Found during:** Checkpoint verification (Task 3)
- **Issue:** Generic guidance copy "Download it in System Settings" was too vague; System Settings action opened to last-viewed pane instead of Language & Region
- **Fix:** Updated guidance copy to include explicit navigation path: "System Settings → General → Language & Region → Translation Languages"
- **Files modified:** `Transy/Settings/SettingsView.swift`
- **Commit:** `090f763`
- **Note:** URL scheme `x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.Localization-Settings` does open Language & Region, but cannot deep-link to Translation Languages sub-section; explicit copy compensates for this macOS limitation

## Verification Results

✅ All plan verification criteria met:
- TranslationModelGuidanceTests passes (5 tests)
- Full test suite passes (37 tests in 11 suites)
- Build succeeds without warnings
- Picker shows valid target after language loading
- Guidance copy includes explicit System Settings path

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Picker reconciliation:** Manage selection via separate @State to handle async language loading; reconcile stored target with supported options after load completes
2. **Fallback behavior:** If stored target not in supported list, select first supported language and update store automatically (graceful degradation)
3. **Runtime relevance recording:** Record missing-model context from `PopupView` preflight outcome without mutating active popup state
4. **Guidance state machine:** Three states (none/generic/pairSpecific) driven by `missingModelContext` and optional `LanguageAvailability.status()` check
5. **System Settings action:** Open Language & Region pane via URL scheme; rely on explicit guidance copy for Translation Languages sub-section navigation
6. **PreflightResult refinement:** Distinguish `.missingModel` (supported but not installed) from `.unsupported` (not supported) and `.failed` (other errors)

## Files Created

1. **Transy/Settings/SupportedLanguageOption.swift**
   - Loads supported languages from Apple's `LanguageAvailability.supportedLanguages`
   - Maps each language to localized display name via `Locale.current.localizedString(forIdentifier:)`
   - Sorted naturally by display name

2. **Transy/Settings/TranslationModelGuidance.swift**
   - Conditional guidance state machine (none/generic/pairSpecific)
   - Injected `statusProvider` for testability
   - Returns `.none` when model installed or pair unsupported

3. **TransyTests/TranslationModelGuidanceTests.swift**
   - Wave 0 coverage for guidance state transitions
   - Tests: no guidance before relevance, generic after missing-model with unknown pair, pair-specific when known pair is supported, no guidance when installed/unsupported

## Files Modified

1. **Transy/Settings/SettingsView.swift**
   - Replaced placeholder with real compact pane
   - Target-language picker populated from supported languages
   - Conditional guidance section (generic/pair-specific variants)
   - Picker reconciliation logic for first-launch blank fix
   - Explicit System Settings path in guidance copy

2. **Transy/Settings/SettingsStore.swift**
   - Added `missingModelContext` property
   - Added `recordMissingModel()` method for runtime relevance recording

3. **Transy/Translation/TranslationAvailabilityClient.swift**
   - Refined `PreflightResult` enum to include `.missingModel` case
   - Map `LanguageAvailability.Status.supported` to `.missingModel` (not `.ready`)

4. **Transy/Popup/PopupView.swift**
   - Accept `settingsStore` parameter
   - Record missing-model relevance when preflight returns `.missingModel`
   - No mutation of active popup state

5. **Transy/AppDelegate.swift**
   - Pass `settingsStore` to `PopupController.show()`

6. **Transy/Popup/PopupController.swift**
   - Accept and forward `settingsStore` parameter to `PopupView`

## Integration Points

- **Upstream:** Phase 4 Plan 1 provides `SettingsStore` with persistent target language
- **Downstream:** Phase 4 complete — settings window, target language selection, and model guidance all functional
- **Contracts satisfied:**
  - Settings shows compact native pane with broad language picker
  - Target language changes auto-save and persist across relaunch
  - Guidance absent before relevance, generic after missing-model with unknown pair
  - System Settings action opens Language & Region with explicit guidance path

## Next Steps

Phase 4 is complete. Next phase (if planned) would cover:
- Provider selection or external translation service integration
- Advanced settings (appearance, hotkey customization)
- Additional UX polish

## Known Limitations

- System Settings URL scheme cannot deep-link to Translation Languages sub-section within Language & Region; guidance copy compensates by providing explicit navigation path
- Picker reconciliation assumes first supported language is a reasonable fallback if stored target not supported
- Pair-specific guidance only appears when `knownSourceLanguage` is explicitly provided (not inferred from ambiguous runtime state)
